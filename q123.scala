           ~ Java is a general purpose object oriented language.
            Scala is a mixture of both object oriented and functional programming.

           ~ Java variables are by default mutable type. 
             Scala variables are by default immutable type.

           ~ Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent,

            Scala is a general-purpose, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language.
             It is a pure object-oriented programming language which also provides
              the support to the functional programming approach
